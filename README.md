# Psychic-Game

This is a simple letter guessing game.
The computer picks a letter at random and prompts the user to guess which letter the computer picked.
The user has 9 guesses before they lose the game. Duplicate guesses and guesses that aren't letters don't decrease the number of alloted guesses. 
If they don't guess the letter correctly in 9 guesses, their losses go up by 1. If they do guess correctly, their wins go up by 1.
