# Psychic-Game

This is a simple letter guessing game.
The computer picks a letter at random and prompts the user to guess which letter the computer picked.
The user has 9 guesses before they lose the game.
If they don't guess the letter correctly in 9 guesses, their losses go up by 1. If they do guess correctly, their wins go up by 1. 
Duplicate guesses and guesses that aren't letters don't decrease the number of alloted guesses.
